    about section info

    Cryptography was a technique that did not require your trusting other people-that if you encrypted your files, you would have the control to make the choice as to whether you would surrender your files.

    Cryptography is the science of using mathematics to encrypt (encipher) and decrypt (decipher) information. Once the information has been encrypted, it can be stored on insecure media or transmitted on an insecure network (like the Internet) so that it cannot be read by anyone except the intended recipient.
